There are many resources available that describe it (for example [this FAQ](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ai-faq/neural-nets/part3/section-11.html)), and why it is important to optimise for generalisation error and not training error. Please [look these up](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=generalisation+error+validation) if you are not familiar with this concept. The key idea is that we need to set some data aside that was not used for estimating the model so that we can properly measure the performance of our classifier. In particular we will use two strategies for keeping data aside:\n",

For cross validation (for example 5 fold cross validation), the data is split into 5 pieces, and 4 of the pieces are used for training and 1 piece is used for validation. By considering each of the 5 pieces as a validation set in turn, we obtain 5 training/test splits that give us 5 estimates of validation error."

In the example below, we consider the support vector machine, where we have to tune the regularisation parameter $C$ and the Gaussian kernel bandwidth $\\sigma$. How do we choose the best parameters?
