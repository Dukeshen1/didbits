## Time series profile

The Time Series Profile (TSP) consists of 34 tables containing key Census characteristics of persons, families and dwellings. Second release tables will contain Labour Force classifications which include occupation, industry and qualifications.

The Time Series Profile presents data from three Censuses, based on the geographical boundaries for the most recent of the three. Comparing data from different Time Series Profiles is not valid, because geographical boundaries are subject to change between Censuses. Within a Time Series Profile, data for the two previous Censuses is concorded to the geographical boundaries for the most recent one.

The 2011 Time Series Profile compares data from the 2001, 2006 and 2011 Censuses where the data classifications are comparable. If a data classification has been revised between Censuses, data will be output on the classification that has been used in the 2011 Census. Footnotes explain the correspondence between the data classifications of previous Censuses and the 2011 classification. The data are based on place of enumeration (where people were counted on Census night).

The change in the geographical classification standards for the 2011 Census has a slight effect on Time Series Profiles. For example, the Statistical Local Area (SLA) used in previous Censuses is no longer available as a defined region in the new standard. As a transitional arrangement, and only for the 2011 Census, Time Series Profiles have been released at the SLA level. 


## SA3

Statistical Areas Level 3 (SA3s) provide a standardised regional breakup of Australia. The aim of SA3s is to create a standard framework for the analysis of ABS data at the regional level through clustering groups of SA2s that have similar regional characteristics. SA3s are built from whole SA2s and in general have populations between 30,000 and 130,000 persons. They are often the functional areas of regional cities and large urban transport and service hubs.
